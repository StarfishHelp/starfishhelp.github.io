Hi there! Thanks for coming to visit *Starfish Help*!

I believe that education is *the* tool that those in the developing world need in order to pull themselves out of poverty.

In Zimbabwe, no new school has been built for 20 years. I am raising money to support the building of a new Primary School in Mutare.

If you feel that this is a project you could support too, then see if you would like to buy my crochet, or donate on my just giving page on the website.

# About

Starfish Help is run by me, Jill Geddes. I have been a teacher for over three decades and I have a passion for sharing education.

In April 2013 I went to Southern Africa and was struck by the poverty in Zimbabwe and the distances that children had to walk to get to school. I determined to help build a school that could lessen the journey time for the students, but also, be a hope for a better future for every schoolchild.

Having researched for a project, I joined Mission Direct on a two week building project to Joshua Dhube school in Mutare. Far from being the end of a campaign to help, I find I am involved with a school that needs all the help it can get and I am committed to raising money for the school until the building work is complete. When I first went there, students in Grade 1 did not have enough tables to sit at and study. Half the class got off their chair, knelt on the concrete, and wrote on the seat of their chair. I determined not to let that happen again and money from starfish.help has paid for tables every year. Here are some new tables with the Head Teacher. 

I have been raising money for this school for five years. In July 2019 I will go for 7 weeks  to build Year 7  classrooms and see the project through to completion.

An exciting development is that I have been fortunate in recruiting 10 other people to go with me in 2019 We need to raise £11,000 as a team to pay for our part of the build next year. This website will record all our events and activities along the way to our final goal.

## Service above self award June 2018

In June 2018, the Rotary Club of Epping awarded me their Service above Self award for 2018. The President said he was impressed with my dedication. However, I couldn’t have done it without people buying my crocheted and sewn goods. So thank you for coming to my website- and keep reading! Go to ‘Crochet’!

You can get involved today, contact us now!

# Once upon a time…

Adapted from “The Star Thrower”, by Loren Eiseley (1907 – 1977)

Once upon a time, there was an old man who used to go to the ocean to do his writing. He had a habit of walking on the beach every morning before he began his work. Early one morning, he was walking along the shore after a big storm had passed and found the vast beach littered with starfish as far as the eye could see, stretching in both directions.

Off in the distance, the old man noticed a small boy approaching.  As the boy walked, he paused every so often and as he grew closer, the man could see that he was occasionally bending down to pick up an object and throw it into the sea.  The boy came closer still and the man called out, “Good morning!  May I ask what it is that you are doing?”

The young boy paused, looked up, and replied “Throwing starfish into the ocean. The tide has washed them up onto the beach and they can’t return to the sea by themselves,” the youth replied. “When the sun gets high, they will die, unless I throw them back into the water.”

The old man replied, “But there must be tens of thousands of starfish on this beach. I’m afraid you won’t really be able to make much of a difference.”

The boy bent down, picked up yet another starfish and threw it as far as he could into the ocean. Then he turned, smiled and said,

“It made a difference to that one!”

 

This is the inspiration behind Starfish Help – life can be daunting, but we can all do small things to make a big difference.

# Joshua Dhube School

Joshua Dhube school opened in March 2015 with Reception (ECD), years 1 & 2. In July and August 2015 Mission Direct sent teams to build two more classrooms and an office, so class two could move into them in January when they become Grade three.In July 2015 I went to the school to build Grade 3 classrooms. I have been every year since to build classrooms.  Each year,  2 classrooms are built, allowing another 120 children to access education. Two more years and there will be a whole primary school.

So this is an ongoing need.  2018 saw Year 6 classrooms being built, but children stay in Primary school until year 7. This means we need to go back next year to build before the school is finally complete. Each classroom will need chairs, tables and textbooks. All money raised for this project will go to the school. All the classrooms are paid for by voluntary donations. The Zimbabwe government only pays for teachers.

The parents have told me how thrilled they are with the school. It is 4km nearer than the next nearest school and has smaller class sizes- 60 instead of 100!

# Crochet

The main way I raise money for the school is though my crocheted and sewn goods. I make cuddly toys, finger puppets, glove puppets, novelty hats and scarves amongst other things. I also sew glove puppets, cushions and bags of a variety of sizes and uses. I sell these through craft fairs, farmers markets and Christmas markets. I also sell through Facebook. I have a selection of my work here, but if you want to see everything I have made, then head over to Facebook- starfish.help. I am happy to post anywhere in the UK although postage costs may vary for remote areas.
